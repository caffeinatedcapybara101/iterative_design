    <h1 id="top" class="button-34">Iterative Design</h1>
    <p>For this assignment, our group created an interactive design for an emerging start up.
      We choose to create an interface design for the startup Food Court. Food Court is an African start up who
      is essentially creating a version of SnackPass for Africa in order to make quality food more accessible
      throughout the country.
      There are many unique problems in the African on-demand/food delivery market and Food Court is working to
      create a seamless solution. Click the image below to check them out!</p>

    <h2 id="part-1" class="button-34">Part 1: Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
    <h3>Pre-Design Thinking</h3>
    <p>
      For this interface, we have decided to create a mobile app. Because of the on-demand nature of the app,
      we feel that a mobile app will provide the most flexibility and convenience to the users. The target audience for
      this app will be the adult population who have a mobile device;
      specifically targeting young adults.
    </p>

    <h3>Sketching</h3>
    <p>Each member of my group and I each created our own sketches with ideas on how we would design the Food Court
      Application.</p>

    <h3>Combining Ideas into a Wireframe</h3>

    <p> After sketching, we came together as a group to discuss which features and pages were most important to have in
      out final wireframe. Most of our sketches had similar ideas,
      all including some kind of search page, a home page and a restaurant page. Our final high fidelity wireframe had 5
      total pages; a login page, a home page, a search page, a restaurant page and a
      checkout page. Below is an image of our final sketches.</p>

    <P>In this section, we used our sketches to make a real, interactive design.</P>

    <h3>Interactive High Fidelity Mockup</h3>

      </video>
    </div>

    <h3>Mockup Crit in Studio</h3>
    <p>In studio, we presented our design to a group of our classmates. After giving them time to use the interface, we
      were given 10 minutes of critiques about our design. </p>

    <div class="list">
      <h4>Here's what we found ... </h4>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li> SEARCH BAR on Search page: there was no easy way to navigate out of the search screen without clicking on a
          restaurant first. This caused some confusion and frustration for users.</li>
        <br>
        <li> HOURS on Restaurant page: on the restaurant page, someone noted that the hours section was not as clear as
          they wanted it to be. They suggested to add an "open" & "closed" banner to more clearly indicate to the
          user if the restaurant is open or closed.</li>
        <br>
        <li> HOURS on Search page: Several users were confused by the "hours" placeholder on the search page in out
          design. They were expecting to see the actual store hours or be able to click on hours to have them show up.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> REVIEWS on Restaurant page: we have review ratings for each restaurant in our designs, but several users
          mentioned that they would have liked to see the number of reviews for each restaurant to help them determine
          the accuracy of the rating. </li>
        <br>
        <li> NOTES section on Cart page: overall we got great reviews on the cart; one user mentioned that the contrast
          of the "notes" text could be improved to increase readability. </li>
        <br>
        <li> DELETE on Cart page: there is a red delete button in the cart that allows users to take an item out of the
          cart. Some users felt that the red button with "delete" text wasn't clear and that a
          trash can icon would be more clear to the user</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Final Design Iteration</h3>
    <p>After the critique scission, we made a few small changes to our design. The changes include changing the delete
      button in the cart to a trash icon,
      setting the notes text to black, adding a navigation footer to the search page, replacing the hours placeholder
      text with an open/closed indicator and
      adding the number of reviews next to the star rating on the restaurant page. These changes were small, but will
      make a big difference in terms of usability. </p>

    <h2 id="part-3" class="button-34">Part 3: User Testing</h2>
    <h3>Determine a Task</h3>
    <p>
      In order to test the flow of the app, we decided to have each user order chicken tacos from
      Deddeh's Kitchen. This way, the users are mimicking a possible scenario that occurs when using
      the app on a regular basis. When users first open the app, they will encounter the login screen.
      Once they login, they'll be led to the home screen where they can navigate to the Deddeh's Kitchen
      page. From here, they'll be able to order the chicken tacos and proceed to the checkout. The specific
      instructions used for user testing are in the following section.
    </p>

    <h3>Testing Instructions & UserTesting.com</h3>

    <h4> Introduction/Task Instructions for User Testing</h4>
    <p>
      Imagine you're hungry and there are no restaurants around, so you decide to order delivery. You decide
      you want chicken tacos from your favorite restaurant Deddeh's Kitchen. Navigate through the app to Deddeh's
      Kitchen, and add the chicken tacos to your cart. Then, press the checkout button. Please think aloud when
      you navigate through the site as it helps us buils a better understanding of the user's thought process.
      Additionally, this is not a real app but instead an interactive mockup built using the prototyping software
      Figma.
    </p>

    <h4>Tasks for User Testing</h4>
    <p>
      1. Without leaving the homepage, in your own words, describe what you think you can do on this app? Please,
      be specific.
      <br>
      2. Without leaving the homepage, describe what you would select first. **Do not select anything yet.** If
      you would leave without clicking anywhere, please explain why.
    </p>

    <h4>Questions for User Testing</h4>
    <p>
      What frustrated you most about the site?
      <br>
      If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this site?
      <br>
      What did you like about the site?
